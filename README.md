50.002 FPGA project was very fun. Many enjoy. Code for the FSM, control of the LEDs and seven seg display. Manual testing, automated testing and failure cases included. Included code for 16bit ALU with automated testing and failure test case(s). Please starrrr my repo if you find the code helpful :x
