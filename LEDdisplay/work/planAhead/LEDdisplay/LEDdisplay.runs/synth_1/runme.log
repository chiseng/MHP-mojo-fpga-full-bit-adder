Final Macro Processing ...

Processing Unit <mojo_top_0> :
	Found 2-bit shift register for signal <generator_bottom/button_right/sync/M_pipe_q_1>.
	Found 2-bit shift register for signal <generator_bottom/button_left/sync/M_pipe_q_1>.
INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 4-bit shift register was found for signal <reset_cond/M_stage_q_3> and currently occupies 4 logic cells (2 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
Unit <mojo_top_0> processed.
